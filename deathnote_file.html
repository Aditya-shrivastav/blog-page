                <p><strong><em><u>Death Note</u></em></strong> (Japanese: デスノート, Hepburn: Desu Nōto) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi
                 Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius[3] who stumbles
                  across a mysterious otherworldly notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk,
                   and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. 
                   The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide 
                   massacre of individuals whom he deems morally unworthy of life to change the world into a utopian 
                   society without crime, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira" ("キラ", the Japanese 
                   transliteration of the English word: killer) and the subsequent efforts of an elite task-force of law
                    enforcement officers, consisting of members of the Japanese police force, led by L, an enigmatic 
                    international detective whose past is shrouded in mystery, to apprehend him and end his reign of terror.
                Death Note was first serialized in Shueisha's manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May
                 2006. The 108 chapters were collected and published into 12 tankōbon volumes between April 2004 and July 2006.
                  An anime television adaptation aired in Japan from October 3, 2006, to June 26, 2007. Composed of 37 episodes
                  , the anime was developed by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki. A light novel based on the series,
                   written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006. Additionally, various video games have been published
                    by Konami for the Nintendo DS. The series was adapted into three live action films released in Japan on
                     June 17, 2006, November 3, 2006, and February 2, 2008, and a television drama in 2015. A miniseries
                      entitled Death Note: New Generation and a fourth film were released in 2016. An American film adaptation
                       was released on Netflix on August 24, 2017.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named <em>Light Yagami</em> finds the "Death Note", a mysterious 
                black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. After verifying that 
                the notebook works and initially being terrified of its god-like abilities, Light begins to consider the possibilities 
                of the Death Note's abilities and sets out to create a utopian world without crime, killing numerous high-profile 
                Japanese criminals, before eventually targeting international criminals and felons around the world. Five days after 
                discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a <em>"Shinigami,"</em> beings inspired by the Japanese god of death and 
                the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, who is invisible to anyone who has not touched the Death Note, reveals that he 
                dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.[4]
                As numerous criminals and convicts around the world begin to die of inexplicable freak accidents and heart attacks, 
                the global media begin to believe that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him "Kira", 
                the Japanese transliteration of the word: "killer", who is both feared and beloved by the public and law enforcement 
                agencies. Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic and highly esteemed international 
                consulting detective, known as <strong>L</strong>, who has cracked numerous crime cases around the world, to assist them in the 
                investigation. After deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L stages a TV broadcast in which he tricks Light into revealing 
                that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Humiliated, Light vows to kill L, whom he 
                views as obstructing his plans. L quickly deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police's investigation, 
                which is led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that "Kira" could have familial connections with the 
                members of the "Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the 
                investigation, but Light outmaneuvers and kills them all. Nonetheless, L picks up enough hints to designate Light as the 
                prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, 
                with both trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.At this point, a famous model/actress named Misa Amane 
                gains a second Death Note from a Shinigami named Rem. Misa makes a deal with Rem for Shinigami eyes, which allows her 
                to kill knowing only the face at the cost of half her lifespan. Misa commits numerous murders, sends taped recordings 
                to the police, and eventually uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira. Infatuated with Light, she demands Light 
                be her boyfriend. Although he does not love Misa, Light agrees, intending to use Misa's Shinigami eyes to discern L's 
                true name.However, before she can do so, L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem, who has 
                feelings for Misa, threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which 
                he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally 
                driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. Now with no knowledge of the Death Note, Light wholeheartedly 
                joins the investigation. </p>
