                <p><strong><em><u>Hunter × Hunter</u></em></strong> (Japanese: ハンター×ハンター, Hepburn: Hantā Hantā) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated
                 by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since March 16, 1998, although the manga
                  has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. As of October 2018, 380 chapters have been collected into 36
                   volumes by Shueisha. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left
                    him at a young age, is actually a world renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical
                     pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves
                     , or hunting down lawless individuals. Despite being abandoned by his father, Gon departs on a journey to become
                      a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the
                       paranormal. The original inspiration for the manga came from Togashi's own collecting hobby.
                In 1999, Hunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation 
                and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi. The show premiered on Japan's Fuji TV and ran until 2001. Three separate 
                original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and 
                released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television 
                from October 2011 to September 2014 totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 
                2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter. 
                The manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since April 2005.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his life that both his parents were dead. But when 
                he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has since become an 
                accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to take the Hunter Examination 
                (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to become a Hunter like him.[9][10][11] During the exam, Gon meets and soon 
                befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become 
                a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by 
                a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay for medical school, 
                desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his 
                former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family.[10][11][3] Among many other examinees, Gon 
                continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After passing by many 
                trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant 
                due to being controlled by his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.
                After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily for their own 
                personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena (天空闘技場, Tenkū Tōgijō), a skyscraper where thousands 
                of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve themselves, and gain monetary rewards.[12] 
                There they meet a kung fu master named Wing, who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its 
                practicers to manifest parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the 
                Hunter Exam. Sometime later, Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew City (ヨークシンシティ, Yōkushin Shiti) where 
                they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. During the occasion, Two from the band of thieves are killed by Kurapika 
                and he is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest. In order to rescue Gon and Killua, who were captured 
                by them, but not without succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader <strong>Chrollo Lucilfer</strong>.
                A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin playing Greed Island, an extremely rare and 
                expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging's whereabouts.[13] While exploring 
                the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by none 
                other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the difficulty of the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined 
                and trained by Biscuit Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With the help of Biscuit, Gon and 
                Killua train their Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. During their stay on Greed Island, Killua 
                takes a short break to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time passes with success. The trio then complete 
                the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite 
                with his father.</p>
