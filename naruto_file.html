                <p><strong><em><u>Naruto</u></em></strong> (ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
                 It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks to gain recognition from his
                  peers and also dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two parts,
                   the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two 
                   one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's
                    monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</p>

                <p>Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon
                 (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and 
                 Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired 
                 on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered 
                 in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 
                 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block 
                 in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English adaptation is still airing weekly on Adult 
                 Swim to this day. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video 
                 animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards 
                 developed by several companies.</p>
                 <h2>Plot</h2>
                 <h3>Part 1</h3>
                 <p>A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of 
                 the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha, the Fourth Hokage, 
                 seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;[e] this 
                 costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become leader of Konoha again. 
                 Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Because of a decree 
                 made by the Third Hokage forbidding anyone to mention these events, Naruto knows nothing about the Nine-Tails 
                 until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in 
                 combat, earning the respect of his teacher Iruka Umino.[f]
                 Shortly afterwards, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and 
                 Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi 
                 Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, 
                 ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.Then sasuke joins with a rogue ninja
                 orichimaru and becomes his apprentice in search of power. Tsunade sends a team to retrieve sasuke but they were 
                 defeated.</p>
                 <h3>Part 2</h3>
                <p>Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The<strong> Akatsuki</strong> starts kidnapping the 
                 hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their 
                 teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all 
                 the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take 
                 revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi received an order 
                 from Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup. He accepted it on the condition that he would be 
                 allowed to spare Sasuke. Saddened by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As 
                 Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates 
                 Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.

                 With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants 
                 to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world 
                 peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront Tobi and his 
                 allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries 
                 <em>(known as the Allied Shinobi Forces)</em> and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas.
