                <p><strong><em><u>Bakugan Battle Brawlers</u></em></strong> (爆ばく丸がんバトルブローラーズ, Bakugan Batoru Burōrāzu) is a Japanese-Canadian 
                anime adventure[1] television series produced by TMS Entertainment, Dentsu Inc., and Nelvana Animation 
                under the direction of Mitsuo Hashimoto. The story centers on the lives of creatures called Bakugan and 
                the "battle brawlers" who possess them. The Bakugan franchise itself is a joint venture between Sega Toys
                 and Spin Master.[3][4]
                Bakugan seemingly ended up more popular outside of Japan, especially in the United States and Canada, 
                prompting the creation/order of several follow-up seasons (New Vestroia and Gundalian Invaders), which 
                aired in other countries before Japan. The fourth and final season, Mechtanium Surge, was never broadcast
                 in Japan and instead aired in North American markets. However, a Japan-exclusive manga series, Baku Tech!
                  Bakugan, ran from August 15, 2010 to January 15, 2014. This received an anime adaption aired on TV Tokyo
                   from April 7, 2012 to March 30, 2013, followed by a second season called Baku Tech! Bakugan Gachi which 
                   ran from April 6, 2013 to December 28, 2013.[5]
                In 2015, Spin Master revealed plans to relaunch Bakugan. The relaunch was later announced on November 30, 
                2017 to occur in the first quarter of 2019, with the series title announced as Bakugan: Battle Planet.[6] 
                The new series premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States on December 23, 2018, while Canada's Teletoon
                 premiered the series on December 31, 2018.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <h3>Season 1</h3>
                <p><strong>Dan Kuso's</strong> life changes one day when cards fall out of the sky and he grabs one, which he and his friend 
                Shun use to invent a game they call "Bakugan." With other friends, they form a group called the "Bakugan 
                Battle Brawlers." They then are accidentally dragged into fighting for the fate of Vestroia (the home dimension 
                of Bakugans).
                Vestroia loses its natural balance and merges with the Earth and many other worlds. A rogue Bakugan called "Naga" 
                has been tempted to capture the power of the Infinity and Silent Cores, which together formed the Perfect Core that 
                balanced Vestroia, but Naga has absorbed too much negative energy and thus has been trapped within the Silent Core, 
                destabilizing Vestroia. Naga now seeks the mighty Infinity Core so that he can complete the all-powerful Perfect Core 
                and have almighty power and absolute control over Earth and Vestroia</p>
                <h3>Season 2</h3>
                <p>Two of the six Battle Brawlers (Dan and Marucho) return to New Vestroia and discover that it has been colonized by 
                an alien race called Vestals, who are unaware that the Bakugan are intelligent beings. However, three Vestals--Mira, 
                Ace and Baron--encounter Shun, an old friend of Dan and Marucho. In this way, Dan learns the truth about Bakugan, 
                and as a result he forms the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance.
                While battling against the evil Vexos, the top Vestal brawlers, who follow the rules of their Prince. The Brawlers 
                destroy each of the three Dimension Controllers that keep the Bakugan in their ball form, liberating New Vestroia. 
                The Resistance part but reunite six months later when they discover that King Zenoheld of Vestal has attacked the 
                Six Ancient Warriors in an attempt to steal the Attribute Energies. The <em>Six Ancient Warriors</em> engage in a 6-on-1 battle 
                with Zenoheld, but are unable to defeat Zenoheld's Mechanical Bakugan, Farbros.In desperation, the Ancient Warriors 
                give the Resistance Bakugan their attribute energies to protect them from Zenoheld, who has the Bakugan Termination 
                System, a machine built to wipe out all Bakugan but needs the Attribute Energies to power it. These energies result 
                in the six Bakugan evolving. After losing half the energies, the Brawlers decided to attack instead, engaging a 
                temporary alliance with Spectra Phantom, the former leader of the Vexos, along with his sidekick Gus Grav. However, 
                the remaining energies are taken and the Brawlers rush to New Vestroia to evacuate all the Bakugan. Drago, however, 
                refuses to give up, manages to destroy the BT System by absorbing all 6 Attribute Energies and evolves again into 
                Helix Dragonoid.</p>
